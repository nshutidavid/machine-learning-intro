Setting Up the Environment
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official website.
Step-by-Step Setup
    1. Clone the Repository:
       
       git clone https://github.com/username/machine-learning-project.git
       cd machine-learning-project
    2. Create a Virtual Environment:
       
       python3 -m venv venv
    3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
        ◦ On Windows:
          
          venv\Scripts\activate
        ◦ On macOS/Linux:
          
          source venv/bin/activate
    4. Install the Required Dependencies: Make sure you have a requirements.txt file in the repository. Install the dependencies listed in this file:
       
       pip install -r requirements.txt
Example requirements.txt
Here is an example of what your requirements.txt might look like:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
tensorflow
jupyter
seaborn
    5. Verify the Installation: Ensure all packages are installed correctly by running the following commands:bash
       Copy code
       python -c "import numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, jupyter, seaborn"
If no errors occur, the setup is complete.
